# Server Stats Monitor

A simple bash script to monitor server statistics at regular intervals. This script provides insights into server performance by executing `server-stats.sh` every few seconds.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the script.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following:
- A Linux environment (WSL, Ubuntu, etc.)
- `server-stats.sh` script in the same directory

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone or download this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Grant Execution Permission**  
   Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x <script-name>.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script**  
   Start monitoring server stats:
   ```bash
   ./<script-name>.sh
   ```

### Usage

The script runs `server-stats.sh` in an infinite loop, executing every 5 seconds.

**Sample code for the loop**:
```bash
while true; do
    ./server-stats.sh
    sleep 5
done
```

### Customizing the Interval

To adjust the monitoring frequency, simply change the value in the `sleep` command.
